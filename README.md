# Modeling-Analysis-and-Control-Design-of-a-DC-Motor-System
This paper presents the design and tuning of a lead-lag compensator for a DC motor to meet a 0.85s settling time and ~8% overshoot. Despite improvements, achieving both goals was difficult due to motor dynamics and model limitations. Future work may involve optimal or adaptive control for better results.
